        Additional notes:
        - The search window $\Omega$ determines which pixels are considered for denoising.
        - The neighborhood size affects how similarity is calculated between different parts of the image.
        - The filtering parameter $h$ controls the strength of denoising. Higher values lead to more smoothing.
